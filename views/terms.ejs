    <h2>6) Your Submissions</h2>
    <p>If you send us feedback or suggestions, you grant BookLantern a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use that feedback to improve the Service. Notes and bookmarks you create in the reader are stored locally on your device unless we explicitly add a sync feature in the future.</p>
